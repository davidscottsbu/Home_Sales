# Home_Sales

The purpose of this analysis was to use SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Also to use Spark to create temporary views, partition data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.  The analysis was done using Colab in the Home_Sales_starter_code_colab.ipynb file.
